CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous urban driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions. We use CARLA to study the performance of three approaches to autonomous driving: a classic modular pipeline, an end-to-end model trained via imitation learning, and an end-to-end model trained via reinforcement learning. The approaches are evaluated in controlled scenarios of increasing difficulty, and their performance is examined via metrics provided by CARLA, illustrating the platform’s utility for autonomous driving research.},

  abstract = {Driving simulators are a common tool for researching driver behaviour, providing practical, safe, and controlled environments. Despite their frequent use in research, there is relatively little evidence confirming their validity (i.e., how accurately they represent or reproduce real-world driving). Moreover, there is inconsistency in both the types of simulators used, and the operationalisation of “real-world” driving in validations. This systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the evidence regarding driving simulator accuracy when compared with real-world driving. The review included 44 studies reporting a direct comparison between simulated driving and on-road driving in a vehicle. Measures reported for comparison varied but included mean speed, speed variability, lateral position, overall driving performance, and number of driving errors. Simulators in approximately half of the studies achieved absolute or relative validity, whereas one third produced non-valid results. To understand this further, the fidelity of simulators was considered, however this further clouded our understanding as the relationship between simulator fidelity and validity was not straightforward. The findings suggest that the reporting of driving simulator studies requires improvement, particularly around the validation evidence associated with the simulator, the specific details of the simulated driving environment, and the outputs of statistical analyses. Guidelines are proposed for future research to ensure consistency in the conduct, and reporting, of simulator-based research.},

  abstract = {Driving simulation has been used for many years now in research, industry and training to simulate virtual driving conditions. This is largely because simulation saves engineering time and costs, and virtual situations provide an easier and safer way to carry out road and traffic safety studies. Scenarios or scenes that realistically reproduce traffic behaviour according to the traffic flow theory has been developed since the 1980s and traffic simulators are a widely used technology in the research, planning, evaluation and development of new traffic systems (for instance Intelligent Traffic Systems). The aim of this paper is to explain how providing a simulation framework based on the integration of a driving simulation engine and a traffic simulation can respond to the issues addressed by offering multi-level and multi-domain simulation models. This paper describes the integration of the driving simulator SCANER and the traffic simulator Aimsun, where the driving simulator (including visual, audio and kinaesthetic restitution) manages the simulation in the immediate driver environment and the traffic simulator manages the whole road network situation, creating a large-scale, realistic and minutely detailed virtual world.},

  abstract = {For the first time, a driving simulator has been integrated with a traffic simulator at the network level to allow subjects to drive in a fairly realistic environment with a realistic traffic flow and density. A 10mi2 (25km2) network was developed in a driving simulator and then exported to a traffic simulator. About 30 subjects drove the simulator under different traffic and driving conditions and variable message sign (VMS) information, both with and without integration. Route guidance was available for the subjects. The challenges of the integration process are explained and its advantages investigated. The study concluded that traffic density, VMS reliability and compliance behavior are higher when driving and traffic simulators are integrated. To find factors affecting route diversion, researchers applied a binary logistic regression model. The results indicated that the original chosen route, displayed VMS information, subjects' attitude toward VMS information helpfulness, and their level of exposure to VMS affect route diversion. In addition, a multinomial logistic regression model was employed to investigate important factors in route choice. The results revealed that there is a significant correlation with driver route choice behavior and their actual travel time, the need for GPS, VMS exposure and also the designed scenarios. It should be noted that the paper was peer-reviewed by TRB and presented at the TRB Annual Meeting, Washington, D.C., January 2016.},

A reliable map-matching algorithm is an indispensable and integral part of any land-based navigation system/service. This paper reviews existing map-matching algorithms with the aim of highlighting their qualities as well as unfolding their unresolved issues as a means to provide directions for future studies in this field. Existing map-matching algorithms are compared and contrasted with respect to positioning sensors, map qualities, assumptions and accuracies. The results of these comparisons provide interesting insights into the workings of existing algorithms and the issues they must address for improving their performance. Example findings are: (a) not all map-matching algorithms pay sufficient attention to topology of networks, directionality of roads or turn-restrictions; (b) most map-matching algorithms make an unbalanced trade-off between performance and accuracy; and (c) weight-based map-matching algorithms balance simplicity and accuracy and advanced map-matching algorithms provide high accuracy but with low performance. Based on the findings, suggestions are made to improve existing algorithms.},

Models of this phenomenon, which describe the interaction between (typically) adjacent vehicles in the same lane, now form the cornerstone for many important areas of research including (a) simulation modelling, where the car-following model (amongst others) controls the motion of the vehicles in the network, and (b) the functional definition of advanced vehicle control and safety systems (AVCSS), which are being introduced as a driver safety aid in an effort to mimic driver behaviour but remove human error. Despite the importance of this area however, no overview of the models availability and validity exists. It is the intent of this paper therefore to briefly assess the range of options available in the choice of car-following model, and assess just how far work has proceeded in our understanding of what, at times, would appear to be a simple process.},
